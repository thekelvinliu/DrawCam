# DrawCam
DrawCam lets you make simple drawings with a physical object and your webcam!

## About
DrawCam is written in python3 and pygame.
Currently it only supports Linux-based machines as the pygame camera module for OS X does not exist.
I have NOT tested it for Windows.

## Installation
    git clone https://github.com/thekelvinliu/DrawCam.git
Go into the folder, and run `DrawCam.py`!
The script should already be executable, so all you need to do is click it.
If not, either set it as executable, or run it in terminal with `./DrawCam.py`.

## Usage
When the DrawCam window opens, you'll see a red square in the middle of your screen.
Position an object within that square and press `space` to calibrate the camera.
Then, move the object around to draw something.
Note that DrawCam works best when the color of your physical object has some contrast relative to your background.
If the color is too similar, DrawCam will get confused, and the path it draws will not be accurate at all.
